# pyNetEng
Projects from Python Network Programming for Network Engineers.

Files in this repository are from me training for the Cisco DEVASC course or other
learning projects.  Nothing here has ran on a production network but only in GNS3,
VIRL, DevNet Sandbox, or something else similar.

I make no promises of these being useful or even working properly but if you find
any value in any of these scripts help your self and use them with my upmost blessings.

I know that some of these scripts do not follow good security practices like coding 
usernames and passwords into scripts but they are just for learning. 

Please forgive my constant spelling mistakes :)

## Telnet scripts
pyTelRt0.py uses Telnet to remote into a Cisco Router to make CLI configurations 
pyTelSw0.py uses Telnet to remote into a Cisco Switch to make CLI configurations

## SSH Scripts
ssh learning scripts are used with netmiko and napalm
